# 📚 Library Management System in C++

## 📝 Project Overview
The **Library Management System** is a simple console-based C++ application designed to manage library books efficiently.  
It allows users to **add, view, search, and delete book records**, all stored in a file for permanent data storage.  

This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and **file handling** in C++ while maintaining a user-friendly, menu-driven interface.
